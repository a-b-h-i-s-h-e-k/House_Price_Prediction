# Boston House Price Prediction

# Overview
- This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices in Boston based on various features. The model leverages datasets containing details such as property location, size, and neighborhood characteristics to deliver accurate price predictions.

# Features

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Handles missing values and outliers.
- Normalizes and standardizes numerical features for better model performance.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizes key factors influencing house prices.
- Analyzes correlations between features using heatmaps and scatter plots.

3. Machine Learning Models:
- Implements regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso.
- Includes hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.

4. Performance Metrics:
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ².

5. Visualization:
- Displays feature importance and residual plots to interpret model predictions.
